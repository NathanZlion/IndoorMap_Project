# Introduction

Hi there! I‚Äôm Nathnael, a senior software engineering student at Addis Ababa University (AAU), 5 Kilo campus. After spending more than four years in this campus, I still find it challenging to locate certain offices. If this is my experience, imagine how difficult it must be for visitors or first-year students. This challenge inspired me to think about creating an indoor navigation system that works as seamlessly as Google Maps for outdoor spaces. That‚Äôs the foundation of the Indoor Maps project.

# The Problem

Navigating large indoor spaces like buildings on a university campus can be frustrating. Whether it‚Äôs finding a professor‚Äôs office or an administrative department, the lack of clear signage or maps often leads to confusion. Visitors face even greater challenges, whether it‚Äôs a parent trying to locate the registrar‚Äôs office or a guest speaker searching for a lecture hall.

Now, imagine a system where strategically placed QR codes around campus guide users. A simple scan could redirect them to a welcome page, such as: ‚ÄúWelcome to Addis Ababa University, 5 Kilo Facility!‚Äù The system would then prompt users to input their destination and provide step-by-step directions like ‚ÄúTake the stairs to the second floor, turn right, and enter the third door on your left.‚Äù

# The Vision

This project aims to simplify indoor navigation by creating a digital platform that prepares and shares indoor maps. This would save time and reduce frustration for users. Additionally, working on this project would provide a hands-on opportunity to learn about rendering 3D objects on the web, data storage techniques for map-related information, and more.

# Inspiration
One of my favorite games, Mekorama, sparked this idea. In the game, you control a robot navigating an island. By clicking a location, the robot finds its way there, including moving across levels and climbing stairs. This intuitive navigation mechanic made me wonder: why can‚Äôt we implement a similar system for real-world indoor spaces?

# Plan

To turn this idea into reality, I will follow a structured approach:

1. **Experimenting with Existing Tools**: I recently came across a service called Mappedin, which specializes in indoor mapping. I will explore its features to understand its potential.

2. **Building the System from Scratch**: Although Mappedin offers valuable tools, my long-term goal is to develop a custom solution. The project will be divided into smaller, manageable components, such as:

- Mapping the campus layout
- Developing a navigation algorithm
- Creating a user-friendly interface
- Adding extra features like user reviews and photos

If this project resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! Feedback, ideas, or even collaboration opportunities are all welcome. üöÄ
